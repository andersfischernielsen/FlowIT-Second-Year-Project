\subsection{Workflow Given by Lecturers \label{sec:WorkflowGivenByLecturer}}
Another workflow presented in the system is given by the lecturers and is designed by \textit{SÃ¸ren Debois, Thomas Hildebrandt, and Tijs Slaats}. They created a mortgage credit application workflow based on the process of applying for a mortgage in the Danish mortgage institution BRFKredit. The workflow is reimplemented in DCRGraphs.net using the same notation as previously presented workflows in this report, and also to be able to simulate the workflow in the system developed in this project. \\

Besides the roles found during the analyses, the team chose to add a role called \textit{Admin} to all events on all workflows, such that an admin user can execute all events. This will be explained in Section \ref{sec:Usermanual} \nameref{sec:Usermanual}.

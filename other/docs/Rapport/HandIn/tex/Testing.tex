\section{Testing}
This section describes how testing the final system has been carried out and includes a discussion of what extent the system has been tested. \\

A variety of testing approaches have been used to test the system during development. These include unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing in varying degrees. Acceptance testing has been applied after some initial tests were developed.

A testing evaluation was performed nearing the end of the project to decide on which modules should be tested, and in which order. Some components play a larger role than others in the system and have therefore been put through more scrutinising tests. 

The coverage analysis tool JetBrains DotCover assisted in this by providing coverage analysis and an overview of the test coverage.

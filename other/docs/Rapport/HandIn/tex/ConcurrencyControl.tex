\subsection{\label{ConcurrencyControl}Concurrency Control} 
This section will describe the motivation for having concurrency control, which solutions were considered, and the solution that was ultimately implemented.\\

Two major solutions to concurrency control are in use in software today: pessimistic concurrency control\footnote{Distributed Systems - Concepts and Design p. 692} (PCC) and optimistic concurrency control\footnote{Distributed Systems - Concepts and Design p. 707} (OCC).\\

PCC uses the concept of locking which prevents multiple transactions from accessing shared data simultaneously. OCC on the other hand uses a working copy of shared data to carry out a transaction and the changes are validated before possibly committing. If a transaction discovers a conflict between itself and a concurrent transaction, the implementation will decide which transaction aborts.

\subsection{The DCR Graph Parser}
Because the team did not want to issue every HTTP request manually every time a workflow should be created in the system, a simple DCR graph parser was developed, see Figure \ref{fig:DcrGraphParserScreenShot} The parser can upload workflows and events to the Server and EventAPIs respectively. The program was developed as an internal tool, and as such not a tool designed for hand-in. The team thought it might be useful if the readers wanted to try out another workflow than the ones provided. \newline
The parser will not handle failures. It does not clean up after itself if an error should occur.
A short user manual for the DCR graph parser can be found in the Appendix, Section \ref{sec:UsermanualForDcrGraphParser} \nameref{sec:UsermanualForDcrGraphParser}.

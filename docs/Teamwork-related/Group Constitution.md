# Group Constitution

## Working days
* Monday: BSUP 
* Tuesday: BNDN
* Thursday: BNDN

Stand-up meeting directly after the lecture. If there's no lecture, we start at 08.30.

After the stand-up meeting each group member can decide to stay at ITU or work somewhere else. Working at ITU is not mandatory.

## Communication
* Trello for backlog and SCRUM documentation
* Facebook for general communication
* Git for code sharing 
* Latex/Pandoc for report documentation
* LucidChart for charts

## Ambitions

### BNDN
* System that fulfills the requirements
* Collaboration between group members
* Use SCRUM as intended with the method
* All group members should have influence on both code and management
	* Division around 60/40 percent. This means that a group member should always focus at least 30 percent of their time on the part they focus the least on.
	* Division into subgroups when planning  
	* Use presentations to introduce each other to central components
* Test should be performed by another group member. This requires very sufficient documentation.
* Test should be presented as a seperate task in Trello. 

### BSUP
* Use of SCRUM
* Use other group as data for our assignment
	* Interviews every week 	

### Documentation
*  All components should be documented. Elements from RAD, SDD, ODD, and test in focus. 

### Programming Language
* C# 
* Use of F# in small modules if it makes sense and the group member implementing the module wants to. 
* A task can be recommended to be implemented in one language, but it's never mandatory.

### Miscellaneous
* Use projector for notes, when all group members are discussing as a group.


## Conflicts
* Conflicts are handled between the persons in a conflict. If it is not possible to solve yourselves, mention it at a stand-up meeting.

## Sanctions
* If you are late - notify the group ASAP.
* If you are sick - notify the group ASAP.
* If you are somehow prevented from being at a meeting - notify the group, solve your tasks on your own time.


## Miscellaneous
* Use projector for notes, when all group members are discussing as a group.
* Cake is appreciated
* Breakfast to keep chemistry and a good social life in the group.

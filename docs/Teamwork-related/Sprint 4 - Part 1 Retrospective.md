# Sprint 4 / Part 1 Retrospective

Sprint dates: March 30th to April 14th.

- Sprint was too long, but not intentionally.
- Easter was a bitch. 
	- Lack of planning made distributed development hard. 
	- No one really knew what was going on. No vision/goal was set for the sprint.
- Discuss the vision and end product for each sprint. 
- Controllers was poorly documented. Everyone added the functionality needed to their tasks. All controllers should have a single purpose.
- Interface changes aren't up to date (LucidChart).
	-   Interface between all communication modules.
	-   Interfaces in code aren't all up to date.
- Efficient end to the sprint. 
- Product ended out well. 
- Facebook was used to keep each other posted on new tasks. 
- Trello is great!
- GitHub and branches are almost used as intended. Woo!
	- Branch out, don't push to master. 
	- Few merge conflicts
	- Old branches should be removed.
- No more json.net problems. Magic.
- Morten is a better programmer now. 
- "TODO:"s are good in code. Gives other group members an insight in the code that have bugs.
-  Group members have all been included in different modules of the project. Most have been assigned to tasks on client, server and event.
-  Good extenstions were made: Reset, Parser/admin tool,
-  Watch out for deadlocks when handing out tasks. 
	- Maybe we can make a small workflow describing the order in which the tasks should be completed.
	- Trello: Checklist in a task called Prerequisites
	- Work Breakdown Structure 
	- Inform the owner of task that all prerequisites is completed.  
-  Major changes should be discussed in group. If that's not possible, branch out of master and let the group know ASAP. 
-  Create a handin recipe. 
	- What should be handed in?
	- When is the code freeze?
	- Who is responsible for what?
	- What should be documented?

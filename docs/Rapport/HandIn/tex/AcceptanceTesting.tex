\subsection{Acceptance Testing}
Acceptance testing would preferably be done by the receiver and the user of the system using test cases specified by the client in cooperation with the developers. When reaching the halfway point of the development of the system, the software was sent to the product owner of the system, our external partner. Unfortunately he did not have the time to review the software, and proper acceptance testing by the product owner has not been completed.

The team has, using a person acting as the customer, tried to complete acceptance testing to ensure that all requirements have been met.

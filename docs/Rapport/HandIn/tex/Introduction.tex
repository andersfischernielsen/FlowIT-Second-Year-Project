\section{Introduction}
The following report describes the system developed in the course “\textit{Second Year Project: Software Development in Large Teams with International Collaboration}” taught by Thomas Hildebrandt and Rasmus Nielsen at the fourth semester of the Bachelor of Science in Software Development at the IT University of Copenhagen.\\

The report gives an introduction to Dynamic Condition Response Graphs (\textit{DCR graphs}), an overview of the software architecture of the delivered system, how the system has been tested, and why the team believe it is functioning. Both the construction of the system and the report was completed in the Spring term 2015.\\

The purpose of the system is to support the functionality of DCR graphs, and to test the system on a workflow description of the processes in a Brazilian healthcare system. The processes are described by an external partner in Brazil, Eduardo A. P. Santos. \\

All DCR graphs presented throughout this report is generated through the online tool available at DCRGraphs.net.

\subsection{Compiling the Project}
This section describes how the user can run the supplied software on a Windows PC. \newline
The team has strived for making it as easy as possible for the user to be able to run the programs and start the two web service projects EventAPI and Server. \newline
To be able to compile the project the user is required to have Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 installed. Open the BNDN solution file - found in $<$Handin-folder$>$/Code/BNDN.sln - choose “Build Solution” from the “BUILD” menu. \newline
When compiled, the client can be run by right clicking the Client project, choosing “Debug”, and then “Start new instance”. \newline
When compiled in Debug mode, the EventAPI will contact a localhost Server when needed. When compiling in Release mode, it will contact the Azure hosted Server. This is described in Section \ref{sec:RunningLocally} \nameref{sec:RunningLocally}.

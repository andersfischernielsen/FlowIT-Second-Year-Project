\subsection{Initial Plan of Division of Work}
At the beginning of the project the group had an introductory meeting, discussing the members’ expectations of the project, and outlining a group constitution. \newline
To cope with different expectations of the members, everyone had a chance to express what part of the project they wanted to contribute to the most. The team had an agreement that no member should be assigned to work on a single part of the system. The decision was made to make sure that everyone felt ownership of the entire project and thereby making everyone able to test and work on any part of the project when necessary. \\

Having everyone involved equally in the project was declared as a goal for the team, however it was decided not to have everyone contribute equally in team management and implementation of the system. Four members would mainly be in charge of implementation and the remaining two would mainly handle team management. To make sure that everyone were focused on the entire project, a minimum of 30% of a group member’s time should be spent on either code or management.\\

The implementation of the system was focused on first documenting the proposed system architecture. Subsequently the assigned team members decided on the implementation details, and the entire team discussed the possible solutions in unison.\\

The team wanted tests to be a high priority during development.\\

To ensure that the report would reflect the project as well as securing against adding new bugs with new implementation, both a feature freeze and a code freeze were planned. These were planned two and one weeks respectively prior to handin.\\

The plan has to a large degree been followed and the team believes that overall the contribution has been equally divided between the members. For a list of work contribution see Appendix X

\subsection{Non scope}
The following was intentionally left out during the design and implementation of the system:

\begin{itemize}
\item The team realized that some workflows might require storing of data such as a patient record. The team has chosen not to support this feature. 
\item Multiple instances of the same workflow. The system only supports a single instance of each workflow, as the team did not see this as being the cornerstone of the given assignment - however the system supports creation of identical workflows. 
\item The system does not provide a UI for creation of DCR graphs. The team recommends the use of \url{http://www.DCRGraphs.net}
\item Furthermore it is not in the scope of the project to support nested events on a workflow as is possible in the full specification of  DCR graphs.
\item Being able to handle crashes of services is not part of the scope of this project, no handling for this has been implemented.
\end{itemize}

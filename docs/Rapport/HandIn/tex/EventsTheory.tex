\subsubsection{Events}
Events represent activities within a workflow. In the example, Figure \ref{SampleGasFlow}, there are five events, among others \textbf{Read Gasmeter} and \textbf{Bill Customer}. An event may have a role associated with it e.g. the event \textbf{Read Gasmeter} has a \textit{Customer}, and the event \textbf{Bill Customer} an \textit{Inspector}. The role determines who are allowed to execute the event. \\

A state for each event is needed for the functionality of a DCR graph to be implemented. The state of an event is comprised of the following information, see Table XYZ: \\
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}\hline 
 & Options & Default value \\ \hline 
Pending & false $\vert$ true & false \\ \hline 
Included & false $\vert$ true & true \\ \hline
Executed & false $\vert$ true & false \\ \hline

\end{tabular}

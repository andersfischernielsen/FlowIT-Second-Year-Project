\subsection{Hospital Workflow}
This section introduces the workflow, that was used as a sample workflow throughout the project. The workflow was based on a textual description, provided by our external partner. The workflow concerns medical care and treatment at a hospital and is seen from the point of view of the hospital, i.e. all assignments in the workflow are handled by the employees of the hospital. \\

The hospital workflow is designed in multiple iterations: the initial draft and the final workflow. The initial draft was the interpretation of the textual description see Appendix \ref{sec:TextualHealthcareProcess} \nameref{sec:TextualHealthcareProcess}. The initial draft was then reviewed by the external partner. The feedback was taken into consideration in the development of the final workflow. \newline
The team believes that the final workflow supports the tasks the hospital needs.

\subsection{DCR Graphs}
This section will give a brief introduction to DCR graphs. DCR graphs present an alternative notation to the notation of standard flow-oriented processes.

A DCR graph represents a workflow. A workflow could, for instance, be the yearly reporting of gas consumption in a household, as seen in Figure \ref{SampleGasFlow}. A DCR graph is made up of a number of the following two components: \textit{events} and \textit{relations}. The term DCR \textit{graph} is due to events representing nodes, and relations representing edges between nodes.
